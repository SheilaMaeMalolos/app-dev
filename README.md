## Description
"The Platform" is a dystopian sci-fi prison drama horror thriller where inmates are fed on a descending platform. Those on the upper levels take more than their fair share, while those below starve on scraps. The film follows one man's attempt to change the system.

## Summary
The plot of “The Platform” is both complex and compelling. The movie takes place entirely within the vertical prison, with  the platform being the only way that prisoners receive food.  The platform contains enough food for everyone in the prison, but it is only available for a short time each day. Once the platform reaches the bottom level, it is supposed to return to the top and start the process over again.

The main character, Goreng, is placed on level 48 of the prison and is initially naive about the situation he is in. However, he quickly learns that the lower levels of the prison are more brutal, with prisoners resorting to violence and cannibalism in order to survive. Goreng forms a bond with his cellmate, Trimagasi, and they attempt to ration their food in order to make it to the bottom levels alive.
